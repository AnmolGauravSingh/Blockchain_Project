# Blockchain-AI Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict how much reward a miner will get in the future using a predictive machine learning model. The data is taken from a blockchain mining site, and the model will be trained on historical data to make predictions about future rewards.

## Data Collection
The data for this project will be collected from a blockchain mining site. The data will include information about the mining process, such as the hash rate, difficulty level, and block rewards.

## Data Preprocessing
Before training the machine learning model, the data will be preprocessed to remove any missing values and outliers. The data will also be normalized to ensure that all features are on the same scale.

## Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model used for this project will be a predictive model that can make predictions about future rewards based on historical data. The model will be trained on the preprocessed data, and the accuracy of the model will be evaluated using a test set.

## Results
The results of this project will be a predictive model that can accurately predict future rewards for miners. The model will be evaluated using a test set, and the accuracy of the model will be reported.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to predict future rewards for miners. The model can be used to help miners make informed decisions about their mining activities and optimize their rewards.
